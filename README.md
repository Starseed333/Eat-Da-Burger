# **Eat-Da-Burger**


### **Description**

A full stack application with persistent data using MySQL.  The app presents you with an available list of ready to "devour" burgers on the left side of the page. You can click on the one you would like and this then sends the "devoured" burger to the right side of the screen. Beware, since these burgers are delicious there's not too many left, therefore, you can add a burger or create an entire burger for you to devour! Enjoy!!
